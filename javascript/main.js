        "Leading with purpose: Shaping the future in Sierra Leone",
        "March 7, 2025",
        "Mabinty Thullay turned financial independence into a leadership role, becoming the first female teacher in her village school. Now, she's inspiring other women to follow in her footsteps. Mabinty Thullay, a 36-year-old mother of three, is a thriving entrepreneur in Mafaray, Sierra Leone. She farms and trades in fuel, rice, and groundnuts—but her true passion is education. Thanks to support from a CARE Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA), she gained financial independence, and with it, the confidence to step into a leadership role. Noticing that there were only male teachers at the local primary school, Mabinty “thought it fit that women can also do what men do.” She spoke to the head teacher and soon became the school’s  first female teacher. Now, she’s encouraging other women to follow in her footsteps. Mabinty’s presence in the classroom is more than symbolic. She incorporates music into her lessons, making learning engaging and accessible. In rural farming communities, where children may be pulled from classes for seasonal work, her methods help keep students on track.",

        "Young trees adapt to drought, offering hope for future forests",
        "March 31, 2025",
        "A Swiss research finds that young trees in dry conditions develop drought resistance, with twigs adapting faster than leaves. This resilience could help forests withstand climate change. Recent research in a Swiss forest has revealed an encouraging discovery about the future of forests. Scientists found that young trees growing in naturally drier conditions might become more drought-resistant than older trees that grew accustomed to abundant water. The study, published in the American Journal of Botany, took place in Switzerland’s Pfynwald forest in the Rhône Valley. In 2003, researchers began a unique experiment by giving some century-old Scots pine trees twice their normal rainfall—an additional 60 centimeters of water each year. A decade later, researchers stopped watering half of these well-hydrated trees. This created three distinct groups: trees that continued receiving extra water, trees suddenly cut off from additional water, and naturally drought-resistant trees that had always survived on natural rainfall alone. The results provided valuable insights into forest adaptation. Even seven years after losing their extra water supply, the previously irrigated trees showed signs of extreme stress. Their leaves displayed characteristics of plants facing severe drought conditions beyond what researchers observed in trees that had always relied on natural rainfall.",

        "Ten youth climate champions to receive fundings",
        "March 26, 2025",
        "The Global Youth Climate Summit 2025 in Brazil will bring together young leaders to tackle climate challenges. Ten youth champions will receive funding to community projects, fostering climate action. The Global Youth Climate Summit 2025 is set to take place from April 2 to 5 at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This event will gather 500 young leaders, aged 18 to 32, from the Global South and beyond to address pressing climate challenges. Organized by the Global Youth Leadership Center (GYLC), the summit aims to enhance participants’ understanding of climate science, develop their leadership skills, and support their climate action initiatives. The event will host 200 attendees in person and 300 virtually, facilitating a broad exchange of ideas and solutions. A notable feature of the Global Youth Climate Summit 2025 is the selection of 10 youth climate champions from vulnerable countries to receive $1,000 each for implementing climate and biodiversity projects in their communities. This initiative empowers young leaders to effect tangible change in areas most affected by climate issues. The outcomes of the summit have direct implications for the general public. By equipping young leaders with knowledge and resources, the event fosters the development of community-based solutions to climate challenges. These grassroots initiatives can lead to improved environmental policies and practices, benefiting society as a whole.",

        "Researchers new discovery: rapid liver regeneration",
        "March 30, 2025",
        "Spanish researchers have identified a rapid liver repair mechanism activated within minutes of damage, offering hope for new treatments for severe liver conditions. Research at the National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), published today in Nature, has discovered in animal models a previously unknown mechanism of liver regeneration. It is a process that is triggered very quickly, just a few minutes after acute liver damage occurs, with the amino acid glutamate playing a key role. Liver regeneration was known to occur through the proliferation of liver cells, known as hepatocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms involved were not fully understood. This current discovery is very novel, as it describes communication between two different organs, the liver and bone marrow, involving the immune system. The results show that liver and bone marrow are interconnected by glutamate. After acute liver damage, liver cells, called hepatocytes, produce glutamate and send it into the bloodstream; through the blood, glutamate reaches the bone marrow, inside the bones, where it activates monocytes, a type of immune system cell. Monocytes then travel to the liver and along the way become macrophages – also immune cells. The presence of glutamate reprogrammes the metabolism of macrophages, and these consequently begin to secrete a growth factor that leads to an increase in hepatocyte production.",

        "Three orangutans rescued from illegal captivity, finally returned",
        "March 27, 2025",
        "In a heartwarming milestone for great ape conservation, rescued orphaned oranguetangs has been released into the jungles of Borneo following rehabilitation. After spending four years at the Bornean Orangutan Rescue Alliance (BORA) Rescue and Rehabilitation Center learning how to survive independently in the jungle, she has been allowed to return to her home in the Busang Ecosystem. The news was announced by the Orangutan Project, a leading conservation organization dedicated to protecting the Critically Endangered orangutans. Mary was released alongside her two close companions Jojo and Bonti who now live wild and free in one of Borneo’s last remaining viable habitats.",

        "Humpback whales are now singing more",
        "March 1, 2025",
        "The number of whale songs detected is associated with shifting food sources, according to the California scientists, the humpbacks singing has nearly doubled. When monitoring baleen whale songs in the Pacific Ocean, researchers found year-to-year variations corollated with changes in the availability of the species they forage on. In vast oceans, monitoring populations of large marine animals can be a “major challenge” for ecologists, explained Dr. John Ryan, a biological oceanographer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California (MBARI). Their team deployed underwater microphones called hydrophones to study and track baleen whales, which communicate over long distances through sound. “The amount of humpback whale song continually increased, with their songs being detected on 34% of days at the beginning of the study and rising to 76% of days after six years,” said Dr. Ryan.",
